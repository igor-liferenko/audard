 ### DONE UNPACKING

  You can now edit the unpacked jar files in (the *directory*):
$(readlink -f "$JARFNAME")/

  Then, to pack them back in a jar that replace the extension one,
  note that for relative dirs, zip must be in the directory which is packed;
  and use (mind the * at end of zip):
# cd $(readlink -f "$JARFNAME")/    # so zipping refers to correct relative paths:
zip -sd -r "$JARFPATH" *

  To check the zip:
file-roller "$JARFPATH"

  Then, to test, Firefox may have to be closed down and started again;
  /path/to/firefox/profile/extensions.{sqlite,sqlite-journal,ini,cache,rdf}
    may need to be removed;
  When changing about:config addon stuff,
    must re-save preferences too (with OK, not cancel)

  Finally, to take a diff betwixt the .jars:
# cd "$CJARPARENT"/ # for correct relative paths
diff -Naur "$CJARBPCKDIR" "$JARFNAME" > "$JARFNBASE"-jar.patch
"

#~ # note, the below sets the directories from /home!!:
#~ #$ zip -sd -r test.zip ~/Desktop/addon_extension.orig/chrome/addon_extension.jar/
#~ # for relative dirs, must be in the directory which is packed
#~ Then, with unpacked .jar - can directly replace the original jar..
