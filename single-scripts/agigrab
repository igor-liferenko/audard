## NOTE: when reading DATA, scope MUST be paused/'stopped'! (i.e. you have 
## run a 'single' capture, after which the 'run/stop' button shines red - 
## meaning the scope is 'stopped') - else `agiload DATA ...` will simply 
## freeze!

## ALSO: this script downloads BOTH data for channel1 and channel2 - which 
## implies that you MUST have BOTH channel1 and channel2 traces on the 
## scope window! If you have only channel1 - and this script tries to 
## download channel2; then it will, again, freeze! 

FNAMEBASE=$1

# logging:
logfile=$FNAMEBASE.log
# Redirect stderr to stdout
exec 2>&1
# Redirect stdout to tee using process substitution
# exec > >(tee -a $logfile) # will print everything - many "reading data" lines
# so here we get rid of those lines first (and convert CRs) before we show
# exec > >(sed -e 's#\r#\n#g' | grep -v 'reading data' | tee -a $logfile) # this changes both log and stdout..
exec > >(tee -a >(sed -e 's#\r#\n#g' | grep -v 'reading data' > $logfile))
