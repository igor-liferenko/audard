cp -r /usr/share/perl5/LWP /media/sdhcnonos/ebin/mvs-client.perl/

% perl -MCPAN -eshell

Actually, must call with

% sudo perl -MCPAN -eshell
else HTML::Summary, WWW::Robot ... (req for AuthenAgent) fail building because of permissions..

and sudo apt-get install perl-tk (req by AuthenAgent)
also, yaml  # (else complaints by MCPAN)

cpan> install YAML
cpan> install Bundle::LWP
cpan> install LWP::AuthenAgent

can debug with perl -d mvs li
then use s to step, p to print, hash valuex are examined with x %
so mvs:108-Client.pm:912 - Client.pm:871, and x %$response (not %response, it results with empty array) getting: 'LWP will support HTTPS if either Crypt::SSLeay or IO:Socket:SSL is installed'

$ cpan -a | grep -i ssl
Crypt::SSLeay                  0.57      0.57  DLAND/Crypt-SSLeay-0.57.tar.gz

# just openssl and libssl0.9.8 is not enough:
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
cpan> install Crypt::SSLeay

... and finally it works as it should :D
(note, avoid test of Crypt::SSLeay - if doig them, and cannot reinstall, do 'clean Crypt::SSLeay' at the prompt first)

Remember for scite:
# Required for Unicode to work on GTK+:
#LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8
if PLAT_GTK
	output.code.page=65001
so files open by default in Unicode...
and use the ljutacer2/52.3KB version (more unicode handling for mvs)..

////////////////////////////////

Note, on natty, newer Perl, so now sites with broken SSL will fail by default, and two more packages are needed:

cpan> install Mozilla::CA
cpan> install IO::Socket::SSL

... however, that will still not get rid of errors, so must actually set environment variable to control that, as in:

PERL_LWP_SSL_VERIFY_HOSTNAME=0 mvs up Whatever.wiki


below some errors and an answer from SO:

$res = bless( {
                '_content' => 'Can\'t verify SSL peers without knowning which Certificate Authorities to trust

This problem can be fixed by either setting the PERL_LWP_SSL_CA_FILE
envirionment variable or by installing the Mozilla::CA module.

To disable verification of SSL peers set the PERL_LWP_SSL_VERIFY_HOSTNAME
envirionment variable to 0.  If you do this you can\'t be sure that you
communicate with the expected peer.
',

Net::SSL from Crypt-SSLeay can\'t verify hostnames; either install IO::Socket::SSL or turn off verification by setting the PERL_LWP_SSL_VERIFY_HOSTNAME environm
ent variable to 0 at /usr/local/share/perl/5.10.1/LWP/Protocol/http.pm line 51.

$res = bless( {
                '_content' => 'Can\'t connect to imi.aau.dk:443 (certificate verify failed)

LWP::Protocol::https::Socket: SSL connect attempt failed with unknown errorerror:14090086:SSL routines:SSL3_GET_SERVER_CERTIFICATE:certificate verify failed at /usr/local/share/perl/5.10.1/LWP/Protocol/http.pm line 51.

<qp l="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/74358/how-can-i-get-lwp-to-validate-ssl-server-certificates" t="perl - How can I get LWP to validate SSL server certificates? - Stack Overflow" d="Wed Mar 30 2011 15:36:59 GMT+0200 (CEST)" s="1">This long-standing security hole has finally been fixed in version 6.00 of libwww-perl. Starting with that version, by default LWP::UserAgent verifies that HTTPS servers present a valid certificate matching the expected hostname (unless $ENV{PERL_LWP_SSL_VERIFY_HOSTNAME} is set to a false value or, for backwards compatibility if that variable is not set at all, either $ENV{HTTPS_CA_FILE} or $ENV{HTTPS_CA_DIR} is set).

This can be controlled by the new ssl_opts option of LWP::UserAgent. See that link for details on how the Certificate Authority certificates are located.

So use LWP::UserAgent 6; should be sufficient to have server certificates validated.</qp>

This option is initialized from the PERL_LWP_SSL_VERIFY_HOSTNAME environment variable. If this envirionment variable isn't set; then verify_hostname defaults to 1.</qp>
